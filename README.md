# Customer-Churn-Prediction_Model
Customer churn rate is a business metric that represents the percentage of customers who terminate their relationship with a company in a particular period of time.   This time frame could be measured on a monthly, quarterly, or an annual basis, depending on the industry and product. Subscription-based companies (think mobile service providers, SaaS, and content platforms) typically measure churn over shorter periods of time.  Customer churn is also indicative of business health. While there are multiple reasons why customers may defect, some of the most common reasons include poor service or product quality, price, and other macroeconomic factors like a recession.  The ability to predict churn is key to preventing it. And thatâ€™s where machine learning comes in. Organizations relying solely on customer feedback for churn prediction often overlook other variables influencing churn.
